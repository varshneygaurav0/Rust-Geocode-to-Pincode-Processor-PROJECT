This is a containerized Rust application designed to perform reverse geocoding. It reads a list of geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) from an Excel file, queries the [Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) API](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/ui/reverse.html) to find the corresponding postal code for each, and then writes the results to a new Excel file.
